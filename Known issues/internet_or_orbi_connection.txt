During reboot of the computer there might come an issue that you don't have internet or the orbi doesn't communicate.
This is because the default setting of computers is trying to get internet trough ethernet cable. So you need to set it otherwise:

1. go to "control panel"
2. "Network and Sharing"
3. on the left side you should see "Change adapter settings"
4. Right click on Wi-fi and open "properties"
5. find "internet protocol version 4 (TCP/IPv4)" option in the list and click it once and open "properties".
6. "Advanced..."
10. if you don't have internet:
    10.1. Uncheck the "Automatic metric" option
    10.2. Insert "1" to the "Interface metric" entry
    10.3. "ok" out of the windows
    10.4. Check connection to internet and orbi
11. No orbi connection: Reboot or ...
    11.1. click the "Automatic metric" option on.
    11.2. check if the orbi connection is now ok. Might need a reboot.
    11.3. Check if internet is ok and if not go to step 10.
